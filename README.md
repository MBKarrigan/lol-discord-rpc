<h5 style="color: red;">DONT USE CID USED ON THIS SCREENSHOT, ITS NOT A REAL ID.</h5>
First of all, you have to create a new app on <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Developers </a> and copy it's Client ID. Name of this app will be shown in your profile, so choose a good one. Now, you should open this app, it will ask you for this Client ID, paste it and press "Enter" on your keyboard. Thats all!
When you are in game, it will display your gamemode, champion, level, KDA and current gold, if you are offline, it will output the word "Offline" and if there are any problems with getting data, it will show it to. 


## Attention!

It will show "Unable to... fuck it what?" for a short time when you are loading in to the game, gut as soon as game starts, it should work right.<br />
This app has a little latency, im not  sure why tho, but it may stop updating your status for  about 5 seconds and return to work again.<br />

## Q&A 

Why did VirusTotal find it as a malware?  
-This script works with network port on your local machine. These ports are opened by League of Legends. This app gets data from this ports and sends it to your discord bot, so it will be displayed in Discord

Why do i have this SmartScreen thing?
-This app is made and compiled by me, im not a popular software publisher, also im not that crazy to waste about 200$/year to sign all my apps. This app is self-signed, since it itnt installed frequently, windows lets you know that it may harm your computer, because its not sure about this code.

What if i dont trust you?
-There is a .py file. You can see code <a href="https://github.com/MBKarrigan/lol-discord-rpc/blob/main/DRCP%20for%20LoL.py">here</a>. If you have 0 trust to me, you can download this .py file and use it like that, but you will need to install Python and all dependancies. On the other hand, you can do all of it, and compile this code using pyinstaller as i did.
